#Full Stack Web Development Practice Repository 🚀

This repository is dedicated to my full stack web development learning and practice, where I work on building strong fundamentals and gradually move towards advanced, production-level concepts using modern web technologies.

##📌 Purpose of This Repository

Practice core frontend and backend concepts

Build UI components, APIs, and full stack features

Understand how web systems work internally

Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals across browser and server

Apply learning through hands-on projects

Track progress over time with real implementations

##🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure and semantics

CSS3 – Layouts, responsiveness, and styling systems

JavaScript (ES6+) – Core language, async behavior, DOM, and server logic

TypeScript – Type safety and maintainable code

React – Component-based frontend development

Next.js – Full stack React framework

Node.js / Bun / Cloudflare Workers – JavaScript runtimes

Express.js – Backend APIs and middleware

MongoDB & PostgreSQL – NoSQL and SQL databases

Prisma & Drizzle – ORMs and database abstractions

Tailwind CSS / Material UI / Shadcn – Styling and UI systems

##📂 What You’ll Find Here

Frontend practice using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

DOM manipulation, events, and browser APIs

React components, hooks, routing, and state management

Backend APIs, authentication, and middleware
